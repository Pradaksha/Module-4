# Exp.No:20  
## SEB -Write a Python class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width, has 2 methods.
## 1. setvalues - to set the values of length and breadth
## 2. a method which will compute the area of a rectangle.

### AIM  

To write a Python program that defines a Rectangle class with methods to set the length and breadth and compute the area of the rectangle.

### ALGORITHM
1.Start the program.

2.Define a class named Rectangle.

3.Inside the class, define a method setvalues(self, length, breadth):
 This method sets the instance variables length and breadth with the given arguments5..

4.Define another method area(self):
This method calculates the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = length Ã— breadth.
It then prints the area.

5.In the main part of the program:
Accept two integers from the user: length and breadth.
Create an object of the Rectangle class.
Call setvalues() method with the user inputs.
Call the area() method to compute and display the area.

6.End the program.

### PROGRAM

```
# Reg.No-212223020020
# Name-Pradaksha V
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a*b
print(c)

```

### RESULT
The program successfully creates a Rectangle object, accepts length and breadth values from the user, sets these values, computes the area, and displays it correctly.
